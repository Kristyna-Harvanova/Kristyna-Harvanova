Welcome! I'm a student, musician, and a tutor, currently living and studying in [Prague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague), [Czech Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic).

- 👩‍💻 I’m studying AI - Natural Language Processing at the [Faculty of Mathematics and Physics](https://www.mff.cuni.cz/en) of [Charles University](https://cuni.cz/UKEN-1.html).
- 🎹 At the same time, I’m studying piano (jazz and classical) at the [Jaroslav Ježek’s Conservatory](https://www.kjj.cz/).
- 🎭 As a teacher I work with young musical theater’s talents. We are currently finalists of [DWC](https://www.dwcworld.com) for the 4th time in a row.
- 🎤 I’m an active member of the famous [Kühn’s choir](https://www.kuhnchoir.cz/en).
- 💖 I try to learn new things in all different kinds of fields. I believe that the more one knows, the more one can enjoy life and see the beauty in it.


## Last projects:
- [Jazz Chord Generator](https://github.com/Kristyna-Harvanova/Jazz-Chord-Generator) - a little help for jazz musicians. I know, we don't want to, but let's go practice!
